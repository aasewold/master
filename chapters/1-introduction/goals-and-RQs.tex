\section{Goals and Research Questions}

The goal of this specialization project is to set up CARLA on our own hardware and use it to train and evaluate TransFuser locally. This will be valuable experience to have for our master's thesis. To reach this goal we will answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    %\item \textbf{RQ1:} How do we set up CARLA to run on our own hardware (IDUN/nap02)?
    %\item \textbf{RQ2:} Can we train and evaluate TransFuser successfully on our own hardware?
    %\item \textbf{RQ3:} How does our local evaluation compare to the results from \textcite{transfuser-pami}?

    % eventuelt  -->  +1 
    \item[\textbf{RQ1:}] How can we utilize the available compute resources to train TransFuser?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2:}] How does TransFuser perform using the adapted training method?
    % \item \textbf{RQ3:} Which mistakes does TransFuser do (and how can we fix them)? (ref future work)
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{RQ1:} Hva er state-of-the-art (i et simulert milj√∏ / i CARLA)?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} Kan vi gjenskape state-of-the-art i CARLA?
    \item \textbf{RQ?:} Hvordan sette opp CARLA i IDUN(?)
    \item \textbf{RQ?:} Can we evaluate the TransFuser model using their pre-trained weights?
    \item \textbf{RQ?:} Can we evaluate the TransFuser model using our re-trained weights?
\end{itemize}
