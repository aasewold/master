The work in this thesis has produced the following contributions,
which can be found on our GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/orgs/aasewold}}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An updated TransFuser codebase which works on the newest version of CARLA (0.9.14).
    \item Methodology to use the CARLA simulator for data generation on NTNU's HPC cluster Idun.
    \item Methodology to train and evaluate TransFuser locally in reproducible environments.
    \item Python stub files for the CARLA Python API. These allow code editors to show type hints and auto-completion for classes and methods imported from the CARLA package.
    \item Carlo, a Python client which connects to and interacts with the CARLA simulator.
