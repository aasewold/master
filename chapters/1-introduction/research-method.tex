\section{Research Method}

This specialization project is based on an experimental research method. We will conduct experiments using the Longest6 benchmark in the CARLA simulator. The benchmark consists of 36 routes from six different towns, where each route has a unique environmental condition based on a combination of weather and lighting conditions.

We will mainly use a quantitative analysis of the results. The performance metrics Longest6 outputs are route completion, infraction score, driving score and infractions per kilometer \cite{transfuser-pami}, all which can be used to compare the different experiments. Additionally we will also perform a qualitative analysis on the video output from the evaluation runs. This will be done by inspecting the first-person and birds-eye views of the autonomous vehicle while it is driving through the scenarios.
