\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

%The conclusion chapter is usually quite short - a paragraph or two - mainly summarising what was achieved in the project. It should answer the claim part of the introduction. It should also say something about what comes next ("future work").

While the results are not entirely satisfying,
showing much lower performance than expected,
the experiments have still proven that training a custom TransFuser agent
and evaluating it on CARLA version 0.9.13
is possible on the available hardware.
The knowledge from running the experiments
have resulted in a well-documented method,
as well as multiple points to improve upon in the future.

We are satisfied with the development of the Carlo client
that assists in inspecting the driving performance of evaluation runs while they are active.
The containerization and tooling developed to enable the simulator to run on Idun
will also provide useful in future experiments.
Using the Idun cluster,
multiple experiments and evaluations can be performed in parallel,
significantly speeding up research.
Additionally, using the Idun cluster enables entirely new methods of compute-intensive learning
such as Direct Behaviour Learning and Reinforcement Learning,
both of which are intractable to execute in a reasonable time frame without opportunities for parallel training.
